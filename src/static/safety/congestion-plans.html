                <p>
                    Mobility and Economy is one of six key performance areas (KPA) at
                    SHA which aims to Support Maryland Economy and Communities with
                    Reliable Movement of People and Goods.  The material provided in the
                    annual mobility report can roughly be divided into reporting on the
                    mobility trends and providing a description on the mitigation strategies.
                    The 2014 Maryland Annual Mobility Report describes the calendar year 2013
                    performance as it related to mobility trends in Maryland and how SHA is
                    focusing to address these challenges. This includes elements such as
                    Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSM&O), multi-modalism,
                    and the capital projects SHA has accomplished in the past year.

                        The following is a summary of congestion and reliability trends on the Maryland highway network in 2013:

                    <a class="list-group-item">
                        The annual vehicle miles travelled (VMT) was 56.5 billion. This is a 0.2% increase over 2012 and
                        is approximately 0.5% lower than the all-time high of 56.8 billion in 2007. Approximately 71% of the
                        VMT occurred on state highways including toll facilities. 2013 VMT in the Baltimore - Washington
                        region was 44.4 billion, whereas as 12.1 billion VMT occurred on the Eastern Shore, Southern and Western Maryland.
                    </a>
                    <a class="list-group-item">
                        In the last five years, changes in VMT has varied by locality. Baltimore City has seen a 6%
                        drop in VMT while Counties such as Howard and St. Maryâ€™s experienced a 4% increase.

                    <a class="list-group-item">
                        The Maryland freeway/expressway system was analyzed using private sector vehicle probe speed data
                        which shows that 8% of the system experienced heavy to severe congested conditions in the AM peak
                        hour. Congestion levels in the PM peak hour were worse, with 12% of the system experiencing heavy
                        to severe congested conditions.
                    </a>
                    <a class="list-group-item">
                        In 2013, on freeways/expressways, 16% of the AM peak hour VMT and 22% of the PM peak hour
                        VMT was in congested conditions compared to 23% and 33% (AM and PM peak hour respectively)
                        in 2012. On weekdays, almost 100% of the peak hour congestion occurred in the Baltimore - Washington region.

                    <a class="list-group-item">
                        Travelers on Maryland freeways/expressways experienced a total annual delay of 21.2 million
                        hours and consumed 8.5 million gallons of extra fuel due to congestion. This translates into
                        $775 million dollars of annual user costs due to congestion.
