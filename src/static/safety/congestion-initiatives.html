                    To mitigate growth in travel demand, Maryland supports a variety of Travel Demand
                    Management (TDM) strategies to support the use of alternatives to the single-occupant
                    vehicle, including ridesharing, transit, alternative work schedules, and teleworking.
                    TDM helps to reduce single occupancy vehicle usage and VMT, generally translating into
                    lower commuting costs, reduced parking needs and decreased emissions.

                        information services through the Maryland 511 traveler information service (which as of January
                        2014 provides information regarding emergency truck parking locations during winter storms),
                        the CHART website and the annual e-Road Ready brochure. The brochure tells motorists where
                        work zones are throughout the state to help them avoid congestion and delays.

                        The bi-annual e-Road Ready construction brochure is available to help motorists navigate
                        hundreds of work zones in Maryland this summer. In addition to other information sources
                        such as MD 511, e-Road Ready is a useful tool to safely guide motorists around construction
                        zones and reduce time sitting in traffic.
