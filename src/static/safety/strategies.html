            Multiple strategies are highlighted in order to achieve the performance outlined in the

            performance tabs.  As you will see our strategies will provide a greater understanding on

            how we intend to achieve the performance we are aiming for in:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Safety</li>
                <li>Asset Management</li>
                <li>Congestion and Air Quality</li>
                <li>Environmental Stewardship</li>
                <li>Project Delivery</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            As you will read in more detail in the various strategy tabs, keep in mind the performance

            goals of the system.  The strategies outlined are fluid and are evaluated internally.  Of

            particular note, the final rules on how and what to measure for safety, pavement and

            bridge, and system performance have yet to be finalized by FHWA.  Once it is fully

            implemented our performance will also be evaluated by FHWA, our Federal partner as

            well.
            </p>

            <p>
            In an effort to increase performance of the system, this evaluation will lead to changes in

            strategies as we examine what is working and what is not.  We encourage you to come

            back to this page as it will be updated annually to reflected changes.
