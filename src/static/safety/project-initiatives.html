                <p>A prominent theme of MAP-21 has been to accelerate project delivery through a variety of approaches.  While MAP-21 originally authorized spending on these programs only through FFY 2014, a series of extensions has carried these themes over into FFY2015.</p>
                <p>One of the ways MAP-21 accelerates project delivery is through the creation of a new Categorical Exclusion (CE) that would affect projects eligible for assistance under 23 U.S.C. that are located in the existing operational right-of-way (Section 1316).  Another new CE applies to projects receiving less than $5 million in Federal funds, or with a total estimated cost of not more than $30 million and Federal funds comprising less than 15% of total estimated project cost (Section 1318).</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21/">MAP-21</a> creates a new Section for the integration of planning and environmental reviews. The new section allows Federal lead agencies to adopt and use planning products in the environmental review process of a project. Planning products adopted through the process may be relied upon and used by other Federal agencies in carrying out reviews for the project.  </p>
                <p>Another clause in MAP-21 relates to environmental impact statements and record of decision.  Under Section 1319, the use of an errata sheet attached to the Draft EIS in-lieu of a Final EIS is encouraged under certain conditions. Section 1319 also allows the FEIS and ROD to be combined in certain conditions.</p>
