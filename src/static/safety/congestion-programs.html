                    Programs have been established to provide incident management and travel information
                    services, expand pedestrian and bicycle facilities, provide ADA accommodations,
                    increase access to transit and address freight issues.

                        <h4>Coordinated Highways Action Response Team (CHART) <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" style="overflow: hidden;"></span></h4>
                        A joint effort of the Maryland Department of Transportation, Maryland Transportation Authority
                        and the Maryland State Police, in cooperation with other federal, state and local agencies.
                        Initiatives outlined in the 2014 Attainment Report include: Continue to enhance traveler
                        information services through the Maryland 511 traveler information service (which as of January
                        2014 provides information regarding emergency truck parking locations during winter storms),
                        the CHART website and the annual e-Road Ready brochure. The brochure tells motorists where
                        work zones are throughout the state to help them avoid congestion and delays.

                        <h4>Capital Improvements <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" style="overflow: hidden;"></span></h4>
                        In order to address congestion and reliability issues, SHA utilizes a variety of strategies.
                        This includes capital projects and programs that implement bottleneck solutions in a systemic
                        and responsible manner. SHA has been advancing the concepts of planning for operations and
                        continues a performance based approach to identify and implement congestion mitigation solutions.

                        <h4>Signal Operations</h4>
                        Traffic signal optimization projects provide for improved safety and increased person throughput
                        on arterial corridors. This is accomplished by the retiming of signals to be more responsive to
                        traffic flows, thereby reducing delay to motorists and decreasing automobile emissions.

                        <h4>Park and Ride Facilities <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" style="overflow: hidden;"></span></h4>
                        All of our facilities are free and can accommodate carpools and van pools. No permits are
                        required and lots are open 24/7 unless otherwise noted. Overnight parking is permitted.
                        SHA has more than 100 park and ride locations throughout Maryland that provide more than
                        12,000 free parking spaces for commuters.

                        <h4>High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right" style="overflow: hidden;"></span></h4>
                        One strategy to improve the person throughput in a corridor is through the use of high
                        occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. The lanes maximize person throughput instead of vehicle
                        throughput by offering a travel time savings for multiple occupant vehicles over single occupant
                        vehicles. The HOV lanes restrict access to vehicles with two or more occupants.
