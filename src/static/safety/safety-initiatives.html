                    <strong>Street Smart</strong> is an annual public education, awareness, and behavioral

                    change campaign in the Washington, DC, suburban Maryland, and northern

                    Virginia area. The campaign is dedicated to educating the public of

                    pedestrian safety issues and encouraging safe travel by foot. The program is

                    coordinated by the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board

                    (TPB), and is supported by federal funds made available through state

                    governments, and funding from some TPB member jurisdictions.

                    In Baltimore, <strong>Street Smart</strong> works through broad-range media coverage as

                    well as innovative marketing techniques that convey location-specific

                    messages to high-incident communities. Information detailing the realities of

                    pedestrian safety is brought to citizens’ attention through radio and web-TV

                    public safety announcements, coverage in blogs and websites such as

                    <strong>DriveSafeBaltimore.com</strong>, electronic advertisements, and newspaper press

                    releases. Roadside billboards and street banners remind travelers to share

                    the road with pedestrians. <strong>Street Smart</strong> annually campaigns in Baltimore

                    City, where over 30 percent of all pedestrian crashes occur, as well as one

                    chosen county where GIS technology has demonstrated significant hot spots

                    of pedestrian crashes.

                    SHA manages the Maryland Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program, which

                    utilizes federal funding. The grants are awarded annually to local

                    government and non-profit organizations on a competitive basis based on

                    need and problem identification.

                <h4>Why Safe Routes to School?</h4>
                <!--<ol>-->
                    <li>
                        According to the Center for Disease Control, 85 percent of children’s

                        trips to school are made by car or school bus; only 13 percent of school

                        trips are made by walking or bicycling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The increase in car trips to schools has added to growing traffic

                        congestion, which creates gridlock near school drop-off and pick-up

                        lines; other drivers stuck in these traffic jams become impatient, even

                        angry, which fuels aggressive driving.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Walking to school helps children feel more connected to their

                        community and increases their confidence that school is a safe place for

                        learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Teachers report that students who walk and bike to school arrive more

                        alert and ready to work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On average, 100 people die each year in pedestrian-related incidents. In

                        2006, more than 690 pedestrians younger than 16 were struck by motor

                        vehicles in Maryland.
