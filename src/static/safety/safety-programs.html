                    SHA works with the Maryland Highway Safety Office (MHSO), providing data derived from SHA’s Safety Information Data base (SHA-SID), based in turn on crash data submitted by the Maryland State Police Central Records Division.  Maryland’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan comprises six major emphasis areas, five of which are behavioral and the sixth is highway infrastructure.

                    <li>
                        Each year, Maryland SHA develops and implements communications tactics to address work zone, pedestrian, bicycle, and other traffic safety issues. SHA also conducts pedestrian safety reviews and road safety audits to identify factors contributing to high-incident pedestrian crash locations.  In addition, SHA is documenting best practices for crash mitigation.

                    <li>
                        Commercial motor vehicles present a variety of challenges in ensuring the safety of both the motor vehicle operator and other roadway users.  SHA identifies unsafe commercial vehicles with roadside inspections and both physical and virtual weigh stations.  SHA and MHSO work to reduce commercial vehicle injuries and fatalities through enforcement of Maryland and Federal truck size and weight regulations and safety equipment checks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SHA reviews data on intersection crashes, as well as lane-departure accidents and run-off-road crashes, and applies engineering solutions where feasible to reduce serious injuries and fatalities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SHA and the MHSO attempt to reduce occupant fatalities and serious injuries through passenger restraint (seatbelt, infant car seats, and booster seats) to mitigate the impact of crashes.Working with the Maryland Highway Safety Office, SHA identifies locations where campaigns against aggressive driving may be appropriate.  Strategies deployed against aggressive driving include both enforcement and education.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SHA works with rail carriers to mitigate the hazards associated with highway-rail grade crossing, through passive and active intersection warnings and controls, and where necessary, grade separation plans.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Work zone safety is important not only for the traveling public, but also to protect SHA employees and contractors.  Work zone safety includes the design of work zones and countermeasures; warnings to drivers and educational campaigns in various media; and passive enforcement using speed enforcement cameras.
