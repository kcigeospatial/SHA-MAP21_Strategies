In the following tabs you will see how SHA is attempting to develop strategies that will help us to achieve a safe and high performing system.",

Maryland safety plans and programs consider safety concerns that may center on people, vehicles, and roadways, in a performance-based, data-driven process. Maryland joined the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), other national organizations, and several other states in adopting a Toward Zero Deaths fatality goal to reduce motor vehicle-related fatalities and injuries by one-half by 2030. To monitor progress toward this goal, Maryland approved interim fatality targets for the life of the Strategic Highway Safety Plan, representing an average annual decrease of 3.1 percent. Each emphasis area also adopted measurable fatality and injury objectives in line with these goals.",
